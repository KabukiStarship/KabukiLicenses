## Why Use Source-Available?

Traditional open-source licenses have a variety of ups and downs that must be weighed by each project founder and maintainer. Most developers pick a license because they feel like they like the idea of one camp over the other, but all traditional licenses suffer the same failure: they're all susceptible to big tech takeovers because the license didn't protect themselves from Open-source Theft, closed-source Software-as-a-Service, and the license aren't successful at creating a sales funnel. Companies such as Amazon that have virtually endless pockets can take over projects with traditional licenses like GPL, Apache License, MIT, BSD, etc by tactics such as paying contributors the open-source project becomes dependent on, then taking over a project's development community by sheer numbers and creating forks of the project then shifting the development to their own project, and ultimately making the profits off of your project through their unfair AWs market dominance while you get nothing. Nothing is stopping a company from using your open-source briefly to create a competitors and shifting your users to their closed-source Software-as-a-Service.
